AB  - BACKGROUND: Easily distributed oral antivirals are urgently needed to treat 
      coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), prevent progression to severe illness, and 
      block transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
      We report the results of a Phase 2a trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and 
      antiviral efficacy of molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 ( ClinicalTrials.gov 
      NCT04405570 ). METHODS: Eligible participants included outpatients with confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom onset within 7 days. Participants were randomized 
      1:1 to 200 mg molnupiravir or placebo, or 3:1 to molnupiravir (400 or 800 mg) or 
      placebo, twice-daily for 5 days. Antiviral activity was assessed as time to 
      undetectable levels of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
      and time to elimination of infectious virus isolation from nasopharyngeal swabs. 
      RESULTS: Among 202 treated participants, virus isolation was significantly lower in 
      participants receiving 800 mg molnupiravir (1.9%) versus placebo (16.7%) at Day 3 (p 
      = 0.02). At Day 5, virus was not isolated from any participants receiving 400 or 800 
      mg molnupiravir, versus 11.1% of those receiving placebo (p = 0.03). Time to viral 
      RNA clearance was decreased and a greater proportion overall achieved clearance in 
      participants administered 800 mg molnupiravir versus placebo (p = 0.01). 
      Molnupiravir was generally well tolerated, with similar numbers of adverse events 
      across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Molnupiravir is the first oral, direct-acting 
      antiviral shown to be highly effective at reducing nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 
      infectious virus and viral RNA and has a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is wreaking havoc on worldwide public 
      health and economies has heightened awareness about the lack of effective antiviral 
      treatments for human coronaviruses (CoVs). Many current antivirals, notably 
      nucleoside analogs (NAs), exert their effect by incorporation into viral genomes and 
      subsequent disruption of viral replication and fidelity. The development of anti-CoV 
      drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to proofread and remove 
      mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and transcription. Here, we review 
      the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading complex and evaluate its potential as a 
      drug target. We also consider existing nucleoside analogs and novel genomic 
      techniques as potential anti-CoV therapeutics that could be used individually or in 
      combination to target the proofreading mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Currently there is not an effective antiviral treatment for 
      COVID-19, but a large number of drugs have been evaluated since the beginning of the 
      pandemic, and many of them have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 despite the 
      preliminary or conflicting results of the clinical trials. We aimed to review and 
      summarize all of the current knowledge on the antivirals for COVID-19 RESULTS: There 
      are 2 main drug groups for SARS-CoV-2: agents that target proteins or RNA of the 
      virus or interfere with proteins or biological processes in the host that support 
      the virus. The main drug groups include inhibitors of viral entry into the human 
      cell (convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, nanobodies, mini proteins, human 
      soluble ACE-2, camostat, dutasteride, proxalutamide, bromhexin, hydroxychloroquine, 
      umifenovir nitazoxanid, niclosamide, lactoferrin), inhibitors of viral proteases 
      (lopinavir/ritonavir, PF-07321332, PF-07304814, GC376), inhibitors of viral RNA 
      (remdesivir, favipiravir, molnupiravir, AT-527, merimepodib, PTC299), inhibitors of 
      host proteins supporting virus (plitidepsin, fluvoxamine, ivermectin), and agents 
      supporting host natural immunity (Interferons). CONCLUSION: When taking into account 
      the results of all the available laboratory and clinical trials on the subject, 
      monoclonal antibodies seem to be the most effective treatment for COVID-19 at the 
      moment, and high-titer convalescent plasma also could be effective when administered 
      during the early phase of the disease. As lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, 
      merimepodib, and umifenovir were found to be ineffective in RCTs, they should not be 
      used. Additional studies are needed to define the role of remdesivir, favipiravir, 
      interferons, ivermectin, dutasteride, proxulutamide, fluvoxamine, bromhexine, 
      nitazoxanide, and niclosamid in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, the results of 
      phase trials are waited to learn whether or not the newer agents such as 
      molnupiravir, PF-07321332, PF-07304814, plitidepsin and AT-527 are effective in the 
      treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Molnupiravir, EIDD-2801/MK-4482, the prodrug of the active antiviral ribonucleoside 
      analog ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-1931), has activity against a number of RNA 
      viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and 
      seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.Single and multiple doses of molnupiravir 
      were evaluated in this first-in-human, phase 1, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, which included evaluation of the 
      effect of food on pharmacokinetics.EIDD-1931 appeared rapidly in plasma, with a 
      median time of maximum observed concentration of 1.00 to 1.75 hours, and declined 
      with a geometric half-life of approximately 1 hour, with a slower elimination phase 
      apparent following multiple doses or higher single doses (7.1 hours at the highest 
      dose tested). Mean maximum observed concentration and area under the concentration 
      versus time curve increased in a dose-proportional manner, and there was no 
      accumulation following multiple doses. When administered in a fed state, there was a 
      decrease in the rate of absorption, but no decrease in overall exposure.Molnupiravir 
      was well tolerated. Fewer than half of subjects reported an adverse event, the 
      incidence of adverse events was higher following administration of placebo, and 
      93.3% of adverse events were mild. One discontinued early due to rash. There were no 
      serious adverse events and there were no clinically significant findings in clinical 
      laboratory, vital signs, or electrocardiography. Plasma exposures exceeded expected 
      efficacious doses based on scaling from animal models; therefore, dose escalations 
      were discontinued before a maximum tolerated dose was reached.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently 
      been tested in COVID-19. We aim to conduct a systematic review of literature to find 
      out the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We 
      systematically searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google 
      Scholar from inception until October 15, 2021, using MeSH keywords. Ongoing trials 
      of molnupiravir in COVID-19 were additionally searched from the ClinicalTrials.Gov 
      and ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials. We retrieved all the available granular details of 
      phase 1 to 3 studies of molnupiravir in COVID-19. Subsequently we reviewed the 
      results narratively. RESULTS: Two phase 1 double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled (DBRPC) studies of molnupiravir showed that 1600 mg daily dose is 
      safe and tolerable, without any serious adverse events up to 5.5 days. One phase 2 
      DBPRC study found significantly lower time to clearance (RNA negativity) with 
      molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily compared to the placebo (log-rank p value = 0.013) 
      in mild to moderate COVID-19. Interim report of one phase 3 DBRPC study in 
      non-hospitalized COVID-19 found a significant reduction in the risk of hospital 
      admission or death by 50% (p = 0.0012). However, no significant benefit was observed 
      with molnupiravir in the later stage of moderate to severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: 
      Molnupiravir is first oral antiviral drug to demonstrate a significant benefit in 
      reducing hospitalization or death in mild COVID-19 and could be an important weapon 
      in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. However, its role in moderate to severe COVID-19 
      is questionable and more studies are needed.

AB  - All coronaviruses known to have recently emerged as human pathogens probably 
      originated in bats(1). Here we use a single experimental platform based on 
      immunodeficient mice implanted with human lung tissue (hereafter, human lung-only 
      mice (LoM)) to demonstrate the efficient in vivo replication of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2), as well as two endogenous SARS-like bat coronaviruses that show 
      potential for emergence as human pathogens. Virus replication in this model occurs 
      in bona fide human lung tissue and does not require any type of adaptation of the 
      virus or the host. Our results indicate that bats contain endogenous coronaviruses 
      that are capable of direct transmission to humans. Our detailed analysis of in vivo 
      infection with SARS-CoV-2 in human lung tissue from LoM showed a predominant 
      infection of human lung epithelial cells, including type-2 pneumocytes that are 
      present in alveoli and ciliated airway cells. Acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 
      highly cytopathic and induced a robust and sustained type-I interferon and 
      inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response. Finally, we evaluated a therapeutic 
      and pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show 
      that therapeutic and prophylactic administration of EIDD-2801-an oral broad-spectrum 
      antiviral agent that is currently in phase II/III clinical trials-markedly inhibited 
      SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo, and thus has considerable potential for the 
      prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of Covid-19 in Nonhospitalized Patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New treatments are needed to reduce the risk of progression of 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Molnupiravir is an oral, small-molecule 
      antiviral prodrug that is active against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      treatment with molnupiravir started within 5 days after the onset of signs or 
      symptoms in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, 
      laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19 
      illness. Participants in the trial were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of 
      molnupiravir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was 
      the incidence hospitalization or death at day 29; the incidence of adverse events 
      was the primary safety end point. A planned interim analysis was performed when 50% 
      of 1550 participants (target enrollment) had been followed through day 29. RESULTS: 
      A total of 1433 participants underwent randomization; 716 were assigned to receive 
      molnupiravir and 717 to receive placebo. With the exception of an imbalance in sex, 
      baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The superiority of 
      molnupiravir was demonstrated at the interim analysis; the risk of hospitalization 
      for any cause or death through day 29 was lower with molnupiravir (28 of 385 
      participants [7.3%]) than with placebo (53 of 377 [14.1%]) (difference, -6.8 
      percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -11.3 to -2.4; P = 0.001). In the 
      analysis of all participants who had undergone randomization, the percentage of 
      participants who were hospitalized or died through day 29 was lower in the 
      molnupiravir group than in the placebo group (6.8% [48 of 709] vs. 9.7% [68 of 699]; 
      difference, -3.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -5.9 to -0.1). Results 
      of subgroup analyses were largely consistent with these overall results; in some 
      subgroups, such as patients with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, those 
      with low baseline viral load, and those with diabetes, the point estimate for the 
      difference favored placebo. One death was reported in the molnupiravir group and 9 
      were reported in the placebo group through day 29. Adverse events were reported in 
      216 of 710 participants (30.4%) in the molnupiravir group and 231 of 701 (33.0%) in 
      the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk 
      of hospitalization or death in at-risk, unvaccinated adults with Covid-19. (Funded

PG  - 740-746
LID - 10.1038/s41594-021-00651-0 [doi]
AB  - Molnupiravir is an orally available antiviral drug candidate currently in phase III 
      trials for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Molnupiravir increases the 
      frequency of viral RNA mutations and impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models 
      and in humans. Here, we establish the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      molnupiravir-induced RNA mutagenesis by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
      (RdRp). Biochemical assays show that the RdRp uses the active form of molnupiravir, 
      β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC) triphosphate, as a substrate instead of cytidine 
      triphosphate or uridine triphosphate. When the RdRp uses the resulting RNA as a 
      template, NHC directs incorporation of either G or A, leading to mutated RNA 
      products. Structural analysis of RdRp-RNA complexes that contain mutagenesis 
      products shows that NHC can form stable base pairs with either G or A in the RdRp 
      active center, explaining how the polymerase escapes proofreading and synthesizes 
      mutated RNA. This two-step mutagenesis mechanism probably applies to various viral 
      polymerases and can explain the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of molnupiravir.

TI  - Discovery, Development, and Patent Trends on Molnupiravir: A Prospective Oral 
      Treatment for COVID-19.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26195795 [doi]
LID - 5795
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic needs no introduction at present. Only a few treatments are 
      available for this disease, including remdesivir and favipiravir. Accordingly, the 
      pharmaceutical industry is striving to develop new treatments for COVID-19. 
      Molnupiravir, an orally active RdRp inhibitor, is in a phase 3 clinical trial 
      against COVID-19. The objective of this review article is to enlighten the 
      researchers working on COVID-19 about the discovery, recent developments, and 
      patents related to molnupiravir. Molnupiravir was originally developed for the 
      treatment of influenza at Emory University, USA. However, this drug has also 
      demonstrated activity against a variety of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Now it is 
      being jointly developed by Emory University, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and Merck to 
      treat COVID-19. The published clinical data indicate a good safety profile, 
      tolerability, and oral bioavailability of molnupiravir in humans. The 
      patient-compliant oral dosage form of molnupiravir may hit the market in the first 
      or second quarter of 2022. The patent data of molnupiravir revealed its granted 
      compound patent and process-related patent applications. We also anticipate patent 
      filing related to oral dosage forms, inhalers, and a combination of molnupiravir 
      with marketed drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and baricitinib. The current 
      pandemic demands a patient compliant, safe, tolerable, and orally effective COVID-19

      breakthrough COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - The precocity and efficacy of the vaccines developed so far against COVID-19 has 
      been the most significant and saving advance against the pandemic. The development 
      of vaccines has not prevented, during the whole period of the pandemic, the constant 
      search for therapeutic medicines, both among existing drugs with different 
      indications and in the development of new drugs. The Scientific Committee of the 
      COVID-19 of the Illustrious College of Physicians of Madrid wanted to offer an 
      early, simplified and critical approach to these new drugs, to new developments in 
      immunotherapy and to what has been learned from the immune response modulators 
      already known and which have proven effective against the virus, in order to help 
      understand the current situation.

TI  - Therapeutically administered ribonucleoside analogue MK-4482/EIDD-2801 blocks 
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission in ferrets.
PG  - 11-18

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a catastrophic impact on 
      human health(1). Widespread community transmission has triggered stringent 
      distancing measures with severe socio-economic consequences. Gaining control of the 
      pandemic will depend on the interruption of transmission chains until 
      vaccine-induced or naturally acquired protective herd immunity arises. However, 
      approved antiviral treatments such as remdesivir and reconvalescent serum cannot be 
      delivered orally(2,3), making them poorly suitable for transmission control. We 
      previously reported the development of an orally efficacious ribonucleoside analogue 
      inhibitor of influenza viruses, MK-4482/EIDD-2801 (refs. (4,5)), that was repurposed 
      for use against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is 
      currently in phase II/III clinical trials (NCT04405570 and NCT04405739). Here, we 
      explored the efficacy of therapeutically administered MK-4482/EIDD-2801 to mitigate 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and block transmission in the ferret model, given that ferrets 
      and related members of the weasel genus transmit the virus efficiently with minimal 
      clinical signs(6-9), which resembles the spread in the human young-adult population. 
      We demonstrate high SARS-CoV-2 burden in nasal tissues and secretions, which 
      coincided with efficient transmission through direct contact. Therapeutic treatment 
      of infected animals with MK-4482/EIDD-2801 twice a day significantly reduced the 
      SARS-CoV-2 load in the upper respiratory tract and completely suppressed spread to 
      untreated contact animals. This study identified oral MK-4482/EIDD-2801 as a 
      promising antiviral countermeasure to break SARS-CoV-2 community transmission 
      chains.

AB  - Molnupiravir, a prodrug of the nucleoside derivative β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), 
      is currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 therapy. However, the biochemical 
      mechanisms involved in molnupiravir-induced mutagenesis had not been explored. In a 
      recent study, Gordon et al. demonstrated that NHC can be incorporated into viral RNA 
      and subsequently extended and used as template for RNA-dependent RNA synthesis, 
      proposing a mutagenesis model consistent with available virological evidence. Their 
      study uncovers molecular mechanisms by which molnupiravir drives SARS-CoV-2 into 
      error catastrophe.

AB  - Despite the availability of vaccines, there remains an urgent need for antiviral 
      drugs with potent activity against SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. Millions of 
      people are immune-suppressed and may not be able to mount a fully protective immune 
      response after vaccination. There is also an increasingly critical need for a drug 
      to cover emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, against which existing vaccines may be less 
      effective. Here, we describe the evolution of molnupiravir (EIDD-2801, MK-4482), a 
      broad-spectrum antiviral agent originally designed for the treatment of Alphavirus 
      infections, into a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. When 
      the pandemic began, molnupiravir was in pre-clinical development for the treatment 
      of seasonal influenza. As COVID-19 spread, the timeline for the development program 
      was moved forward significantly, and focus shifted to treatment of coronavirus 
      infections. Real time consultation with regulatory authorities aided in making the 
      acceleration of the program possible.

AB  - COVID-19 is announced as a global pandemic in 2020. Its mortality and morbidity rate 
      are rapidly increasing, with limited medications. The emergent outbreak of COVID-19 
      prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps 
      spreading. In this infection, a patient's immune response plays pivotal role in the 
      pathogenesis. This inflammatory factor was shown by its mediators that, in severe 
      cases, reach the cytokine at peaks. Hyperinflammatory state may sparks significant 
      imbalances in transporters and drug metabolic machinery, and subsequent alteration 
      of drug pharmacokinetics may result in unexpected therapeutic response. The present 
      scenario has accounted for the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive 
      and overcome this pandemic. Despite the diminishing developments of COVID-19, there 
      is no drug still approved to have significant effects with no side effect on the 
      treatment for COVID-19 patients. Based on the evidence, many antiviral and 
      anti-inflammatory drugs have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) to treat the COVID-19 patients even though not knowing the possible drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI). Remdesivir, favipiravir, and molnupiravir are deemed the most 
      hopeful antiviral agents by improving infected patient's health. Dexamethasone is 
      the first known steroid medicine that saved the lives of seriously ill patients. 
      Some oligopeptides and proteins have also been using. The current review summarizes 
      medication updates to treat COVID-19 patients in an inflammatory state and their 
      interaction with drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes. It gives an 
      opinion on the potential DDI that may permit the individualization of these drugs, 
      thereby enhancing the safety and efficacy.

TI  - Optimal dose and safety of molnupiravir in patients with early SARS-CoV-2: a Phase 
      I, open-label, dose-escalating, randomized controlled study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: AGILE is a Phase Ib/IIa platform for rapidly evaluating COVID-19 
      treatments. In this trial (NCT04746183) we evaluated the safety and optimal dose of 
      molnupiravir in participants with early symptomatic infection. METHODS: We undertook 
      a dose-escalating, open-label, randomized-controlled (standard-of-care) Bayesian 
      adaptive Phase I trial at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Clinical Research 
      Facility. Participants (adult outpatients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      within 5 days of symptom onset) were randomized 2:1 in groups of 6 participants to 
      300, 600 and 800 mg doses of molnupiravir orally, twice daily for 5 days or control. 
      A dose was judged unsafe if the probability of 30% or greater dose-limiting toxicity 
      (the primary outcome) over controls was 25% or greater. Secondary outcomes included 
      safety, clinical progression, pharmacokinetics and virological responses. RESULTS: 
      Of 103 participants screened, 18 participants were enrolled between 17 July and 30 
      October 2020. Molnupiravir was well tolerated at 300, 600 and 800 mg doses with no 
      serious or severe adverse events. Overall, 4 of 4 (100%), 4 of 4 (100%) and 1 of 4 
      (25%) of the participants receiving 300, 600 and 800 mg molnupiravir, respectively, 
      and 5 of 6 (83%) controls, had at least one adverse event, all of which were mild 
      (≤grade 2). The probability of ≥30% excess toxicity over controls at 800 mg was 
      estimated at 0.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Molnupiravir was safe and well tolerated; a dose of 
      800 mg twice daily for 5 days was recommended for Phase II evaluation.

AB  - Introduction: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic urgently demands for both prevention 
      and treatment strategies. RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), which has no 
      counterpart in human cells, is an excellent target for drug development. Given the 
      time-consuming process of drug development, repurposing drugs approved for other 
      indications or at least successfully tested in terms of safety and tolerability, is 
      an attractive strategy to rapidly provide an effective medication for severe 
      COVID-19 cases.Areas covered: The currently available data and upcominSg studies on 
      RdRp which can be repurposed to halt SARS-CoV-2 replication, are reviewed.Expert 
      opinion: Drug repurposing and design of novel compounds are proceeding in parallel 
      to provide a quick response and new specific drugs, respectively. Notably, the 
      proofreading SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease activity could limit the potential for drugs 
      designed as immediate chain terminators and favor the development of compounds 
      acting through delayed termination. While vaccination is awaited to curb the 
      SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, even partially effective drugs from repurposing strategies can 
      be of help to treat severe cases of disease. Considering the high conservation of 
      RdRp among coronaviruses, an improved knowledge of its activity in vitro can provide 
      useful information for drug development or drug repurposing to combat SARS-CoV-2 as 
      well as future pandemics.

AB  - Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health globally. In addition to 
      further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral 
      therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy 
      to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. 
      Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral 
      dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the 
      treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human 
      use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this 
      class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral 
      resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in 
      circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. 
      Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the 
      development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics. This review will 
      discuss the status of influenza therapeutics including the endonuclease inhibitor 
      baloxavir marboxil after its first year of clinical use and evaluate a subset of 
      direct-acting antiviral candidates in different stages of preclinical and clinical 
      development.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late December 2019 in china 
      and has rapidly spread to many countries around the world. The effective 
      pharmacotherapy can reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Antiviral medications are the 
      candidate therapies for the management of COVID-19. Molnupiravir is an antiviral 
      drug with anti-RNA polymerase activity and currently is under investigation for the 
      treatment of patients with COVID-19. This review focuses on summarizing published 
      literature for the mechanism of action, safety, efficacy, and clinical trials of 
      molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

      Mutagenic To Mammalian Cells.
PG  - 415-419
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiab247 [doi]
AB  - Mutagenic ribonucleosides can act as broad-based antiviral agents. They are 
      metabolized to the active ribonucleoside triphosphate form and concentrate in 
      genomes of RNA viruses during viral replication. β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, 
      initial metabolite of molnupiravir) is >100-fold more active than ribavirin or 
      favipiravir against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 
      with antiviral activity correlated to the level of mutagenesis in virion RNA. 
      However, NHC also displays host mutational activity in an animal cell culture assay, 
      consistent with RNA and DNA precursors sharing a common intermediate of a 
      ribonucleoside diphosphate. These results indicate highly active mutagenic 
      ribonucleosides may hold risk for the host.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) has exacerbated the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Currently available monoclonal antibodies and vaccines appear to have 
      reduced efficacy against some of these VoCs. Antivirals targeting conserved proteins 
      of SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to be affected by mutations arising in VoCs and should 
      therefore be effective against emerging variants. We here investigate the efficacy 
      of molnupiravir, currently in phase 2 clinical trials, in hamsters infected with 
      Wuhan strain or B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Molnupiravir proved to be effective 
      against infections with each of the variants and therefore may have potential 
      combating current and future emerging VoCs.

AB  - The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 is an important target in current drug development efforts for the 
      treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Molnupiravir is a broad-spectrum antiviral 
      that is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the nucleoside analogue 
      β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC). Molnupiravir or NHC can increase G to A and C to U 
      transition mutations in replicating coronaviruses. These increases in mutation 
      frequencies can be linked to increases in antiviral effects; however, biochemical 
      data of molnupiravir-induced mutagenesis have not been reported. Here we studied the 
      effects of the active compound NHC 5'-triphosphate (NHC-TP) against the purified 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
      complex. The efficiency of incorporation of natural nucleotides over the efficiency 
      of incorporation of NHC-TP into model RNA substrates followed the order GTP (12,841) 
      > ATP (424) > UTP (171) > CTP (30), indicating that NHC-TP competes predominantly 
      with CTP for incorporation. No significant inhibition of RNA synthesis was noted as 
      a result of the incorporated monophosphate in the RNA primer strand. When embedded 
      in the template strand, NHC-monophosphate supported the formation of both NHC:G and 
      NHC:A base pairs with similar efficiencies. The extension of the NHC:G product was 
      modestly inhibited, but higher nucleotide concentrations could overcome this 
      blockage. In contrast, the NHC:A base pair led to the observed G to A (G:NHC:A) or C 
      to U (C:G:NHC:A:U) mutations. Together, these biochemical data support a mechanism 
      of action of molnupiravir that is primarily based on RNA mutagenesis mediated via 
      the template strand.

AB  - Endemic seasonal coronaviruses cause morbidity and mortality in a subset of 
      patients, but no specific treatment is available. Molnupiravir is a promising 
      pipeline antiviral drug for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection potentially by targeting 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This study aims to evaluate the potential of 
      repurposing molnupiravir for treating seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV) infections. 
      Molecular docking revealed that the active form of molnupiravir, 
      β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), has similar binding affinity to RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 
      and seasonal HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. In cell culture models, treatment 
      of molnupiravir effectively inhibited viral replication and production of infectious 
      viruses of the three seasonal coronaviruses. A time-of-drug-addition experiment 
      indicates the specificity of molnupiravir in inhibiting viral components. 
      Furthermore, combining molnupiravir with the protease inhibitor GC376 resulted in

AB  - Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      has rapidly resulted in a global pandemic with approximately 4 million deaths. 
      Effective oral antiviral agents are urgently needed to treat coronavirus 
      disease-2019 (COVID-19), block SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and prevent progression to 
      severe illness. Molnupiravir (formerly EIDD-2801), a prodrug of 
      beta-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931) and an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA 
      polymerase, possesses significant activity against SARS-CoV-2. Its prophylactic 
      efficacy has been evidenced in a ferret model. Two phase-I trials (NCT04392219 and 
      NCT04746183) have demonstrated that oral molnupiravir is safe and well-tolerated at 
      therapeutic doses. After five-days of oral molnupiravir therapy, satisfactory 
      efficacies, assessed by eliminating nasopharyngeal virus in patients with early and 
      mild COVID-19, were disclosed in two phase-II trials (NCT04405739 and NCT04405570). 
      Two phase-II/III trials, NCT04575597 and NCT04575584, with estimated enrollments of 
      1850 and 304 cases, respectively, are ongoing. The NCT04575597 recently released 
      that molnupiravir significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in 
      adults experiencing mild or moderate COVID-19. To benefit individual and public 
      health, clinical applications of molnupiravir to promptly treat COVID-19 patients 
      and prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission may be expected.

LID - 10.21873/invivo.11946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 
      outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic. Since then, thousands of 
      people have suffered and died, making the need for a treatment of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) more crucial than ever. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors carried out a search in PubMed, 
      ClinicalTrials.gov and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) for COVID-19 to 
      provide information on the most promising treatments against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: 
      Possible COVID-19 agents with promising efficacy and favorable safety profile were 
      identified. The results support the combination of copper, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), 
      colchicine and nitric oxide (NO) with candidate antiviral agents, remdesivir or 
      EIDD-2801, as a treatment for patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The 
      authors propose to study the effects of the combination of copper, NAC, colchicine, 
      NO and currently used experimental antiviral agents, remdesivir or EIDD-2801, as a 
      potential treatment scheme for SARS-COV-2.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA enveloped viruses, members of the family 
      Coronaviridae, that cause infections in a broad range of mammals including humans. 
      Several CoV species lead to mild upper respiratory infections typically associated 
      with common colds. However, three human CoV (HCoV) species: Severe Acute Respiratory 
      Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, 
      are responsible for severe respiratory diseases at the origin of two recent 
      epidemics (SARS and MERS), and of the current COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), 
      respectively. The easily transmissible SARS-CoV-2, emerging at the end of 2019 in 
      China, spread rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
      declare COVID-19 a pandemic. While the world waits for mass vaccination, there is an 
      urgent need for effective drugs as short-term weapons to combat the SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. In this context, the drug repurposing approach is a strategy able to 
      guarantee positive results rapidly. In this regard, it is well known that several 
      nucleoside-mimicking analogs and nucleoside precursors may inhibit the growth of 
      viruses providing effective therapies for several viral diseases, including HCoV 
      infections. Therefore, this review will focus on synthetic nucleosides and 
      nucleoside precursors active against different HCoV species, paying great attention 
      to SARS-CoV-2. This work covers progress made in anti-CoV therapy with nucleoside 
      derivatives and provides insight into their main mechanisms of action.

AB  - Antiviral therapeutics is one effective avenue to control and end this devastating 
      COVID-19 pandemic. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 has 
      been recognized as a valuable target of antivirals. However, the cell-free 
      SARS-CoV-2 RdRp biochemical assay requires the conversion of nucleotide prodrugs 
      into the active triphosphate forms, which regularly occurs in cells yet is a 
      complicated multiple-step chemical process in vitro, and thus hinders the utility of 
      this cell-free assay in the rapid discovery of RdRp inhibitors. In addition, 
      SARS-CoV-2 exoribonuclease provides the proof-reading capacity to viral RdRp, thus 
      creates relatively high resistance threshold of viral RdRp to nucleotide analog 
      inhibitors, which must be examined and evaluated in the development of this class of 
      antivirals. Here, we report a cell-based assay to evaluate the efficacy of 
      nucleotide analog compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their tolerance to 
      viral exoribonuclease-mediated proof-reading. By testing seven commonly used 
      nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors, Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, Ribavirin, 
      Favipiravir, Penciclovir, Entecavir and Tenofovir, we found that both Molnupiravir 
      and Remdesivir showed the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with EC50 value of 
      0.22 μM and 0.67 μM, respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that 
      exoribonuclease nsp14 increases resistance of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to nucleotide analog 
      inhibitors. We also determined that Remdesivir presented the highest resistance to 
      viral exoribonuclease activity in cells. Therefore, we have developed a cell-based 
      SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which can be deployed to discover SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors 
      that are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019, the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, was first identified in the Hubei Province of China in 
      late 2019. Currently, the only role for therapy is treatment of the disease, as 
      opposed to postexposure prophylaxis, however multiple clinical trials are currently 
      ongoing for both treatment and prophylaxis. Treating coronavirus disease 2019 relies 
      on two components; the first is inhibition of the viral entrance and replication 
      within the body and the second is inhibition of an exacerbated immune response which 
      can be seen in patients with severe disease. Many drugs have shown in vitro 
      antiviral activity; however, clinical trials have not been as promising. This review 
      summarizes the current data for the most commonly used drugs for coronavirus disease 
      2019 and will cover the unique factors that may affect the dosing of these 
      medications in patients with CKD. While clinical trials are ongoing, most are in 
      patients with normal kidney function. During a pandemic, when patients with CKD are 
      at higher risk of both infection and death, it is imperative to include patients 
      these patients in the clinical trials.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), necessitates strategies to identify prophylactic and 
      therapeutic drug candidates for rapid clinical deployment. Here, we describe a 
      screening pipeline for the discovery of efficacious SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. We screen 
      a best-in-class drug repurposing library, ReFRAME, against two high-throughput, 
      high-content imaging infection assays: one using HeLa cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 
      receptor ACE2 and the other using lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. From nearly 12,000 
      compounds, we identify 49 (in HeLa-ACE2) and 41 (in Calu-3) compounds capable of 
      selectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, most screen hits are 
      cell-line specific, likely due to different virus entry mechanisms or host 
      cell-specific sensitivities to modulators. Among these promising hits, the 
      antivirals nelfinavir and the parent of prodrug MK-4482 possess desirable in vitro 
      activity, pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles, and both reduce SARS-CoV-2 
      replication in an orthogonal human differentiated primary cell model. Furthermore, 
      MK-4482 effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hamster model. Overall, we 
      identify direct-acting antivirals as the most promising compounds for drug 
      repurposing, additional compounds that may have value in combination therapies, and 
      tool compounds for identification of viral host cell targets.

AB  - A recently published article described the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic 
      profile of molnupiravir (Painter et al. 2021), a novel antiviral agent with potent 
      activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the 
      causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we report an 
      unprecedented collaboration between sponsor, contract research organization (CRO), 
      and regulatory authorities that enabled accelerated generation of these phase I 
      data, including administration of the first-in-human (FIH) dose of molnupiravir 
      within 5 days of receiving regulatory approval in the United Kingdom (UK). Single 
      and multiple ascending dose (SAD and MAD, respectively) cohorts were dosed 
      in randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled fashion, with a 6:2 
      active-to-placebo ratio in each cohort. A food-effect (FE) cohort included 10 
      subjects who were randomized to receive drug in the fasted or fed state followed by 
      the fed or fasted state to complete a fed and fasted sequence for each subject. Dose 
      escalation decisions were accelerated and MAD cohorts were initiated prior to 
      completion of all SAD cohorts with the provision that the total daily dose in a MAD 
      cohort would not exceed a dose proven to be safe and well-tolerated in a SAD cohort. 
      Dosing in healthy volunteers was completed for eight single ascending dose (SAD) 
      cohorts, seven multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts, and one food-effect (FE) 
      cohort within approximately 16 weeks of initial protocol submission to the Research 
      Ethics Committee (REC) and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency 
      (MHRA). Working to standard industry timelines, the FIH study would have taken 
      approximately 46 weeks to complete and 33 weeks to enable phase 2 dosing. Data from 
      this study supported submission of a phase 2/3 clinical trial protocol to the US 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within 8 weeks of initial protocol submission, 
      with FDA comments permitting phase 2 study initiation within two additional weeks. 
      In the setting of a global pandemic, this model of collaboration allows for 
      accelerated generation of clinical data compared to standard processes, without 
      compromising safety.

TI  - Editorial: Current Status of Oral Antiviral Drug Treatments for SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
      in Non-Hospitalized Patients.
PG  - e935952
LID - 10.12659/MSM.935952 [doi]
AB  - On 4th November 2021, the first oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, molnupiravir 
      (Lagevrio®), received full regulatory approval from the Medicines and Healthcare 
      Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. Molnupiravir is an orally bioavailable 
      antiviral drug for use at home when a SARS-CoV-2 test is positive. On 22nd December 
      2022, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the oral antiviral drug, 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) for adults and children with mild and moderate 
      COVID-19 at increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19. These regulatory drug 
      approvals come at a crucial time when new variants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 
      virus are spreading rapidly. Although the FDA approved remdesivir (Veklury®) on 22nd 
      October 2020 for use in adults and children for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring 
      hospitalization, its use has been limited by the requirement for intravenous 
      administration in a healthcare facility. The four FDA-approved therapeutic 
      neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, imdevimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and 
      casirivimab are costly and also require medically-supervised intravenous 
      administration. The availability of effective, low-cost oral antiviral drugs 
      available in a community setting that can be used at an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection is now a priority in controlling COVID-19. An increasing number of 
      repurposed antiviral drugs are currently under investigation or in the early stages 
      of regulatory approval. This Editorial aims to present an update on the current 
      status of orally bioavailable antiviral drug treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Lipid Prodrugs.

AB  - Remdesivir (RDV; GS-5734) is currently the only FDA-approved antiviral drug for the 
      treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. 
      The drug is approved for use in adults or children 12 years or older who are 
      hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19 on the basis of an acceleration of 
      clinical recovery for inpatients with this disease. Unfortunately, the drug must be 
      administered intravenously, restricting its use to those requiring hospitalization 
      for relatively advanced disease. RDV is also unstable in plasma and has a complex 
      activation pathway which may contribute to its highly variable antiviral efficacy in 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Potent orally bioavailable antiviral drugs for early 
      treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed, and several, including 
      molnupiravir and PF-07321332, are currently in clinical development. We focused on 
      making simple, orally bioavailable lipid analogs of remdesivir nucleoside (RVn; 
      GS-441524) that are processed to RVn monophosphate, the precursor of the active RVn 
      triphosphate, by a single-step intracellular cleavage. In addition to high oral 
      bioavailability, stability in plasma, and simpler metabolic activation, new oral 
      lipid prodrugs of RVn had submicromolar anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a variety of 
      cell types, including Vero E6, Calu-3, Caco-2, human pluripotent stem cell 
      (PSC)-derived lung cells, and Huh7.5 cells. In Syrian hamsters, oral treatment with 
      1-O-octadecyl-2-O-benzyl-glycero-3-phosphate RVn (ODBG-P-RVn) was well tolerated and 
      achieved therapeutic levels in plasma above the 90% effective concentration (EC(90)) 
      for SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest further evaluation as an early oral treatment 
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection to minimize severe disease and reduce hospitalizations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir and Molnupiravir, orally available antivirals, have been 
      reported to exert antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. First efficacy data have 
      been recently reported in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We here report on the combined 
      antiviral effect of both drugs in a SARS-CoV-2 Syrian hamster infection model. The 
      infected hamsters were treated twice daily with the vehicle (the control group) or a 
      suboptimal dose of each compound or a combination of both compounds. FINDINGS: When 
      animals were treated with a combination of suboptimal doses of Molnupiravir and 
      Favipiravir at the time of infection, a marked combined potency at endpoint is 
      observed. Infectious virus titers in the lungs of animals treated with the 
      combination are reduced by ∼5 log10 and infectious virus are no longer detected in 
      the lungs of >60% of treated animals. When start of treatment was delayed with one 
      day a reduction of titers in the lungs of 2.4 log10 was achieved. Moreover, 
      treatment of infected animals nearly completely prevented transmission to co-housed 
      untreated sentinels. Both drugs result in an increased mutation frequency of the 
      remaining viral RNA recovered from the lungs of treated animals. In the 
      combo-treated hamsters, an increased frequency of C-to-T mutations in the viral RNA 
      is observed as compared to the single treatment groups which may explain the 
      pronounced antiviral potency of the combination. INTERPRETATION: Our findings may 
      lay the basis for the design of clinical studies to test the efficacy of the 
      combination of Molnupiravir/Favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19. FUNDING:

PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1007/s00044-021-02841-3 [doi]
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, various drug candidates have been developed, 
      molnupiravir (MK-4482 and EIDD-2801), which is a new orally anti-viral agent under 
      development for the treatment of COVID-19, is under study in the final stage of the 
      clinical trial. Molnupiravir enhances the replication of viral RNA mutations in 
      animals and humans. Due to the high demand for the synthesis of this drug, it was 
      essential to develop an efficient and suitable synthetic pathway from raw material. 
      In this study, molecular docking analysis on molnupiravir is examined also, the 
      mechanism of action (MOA) and the recent synthetic pathway is reported. This review 
      will be helpful to different disciplines such as medicinal chemistry, organic 
      chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology.

AB  - Rapid changes in the viral genome allow viruses to evade threats posed by the host 
      immune response or antiviral drugs, and can lead to viral persistence in the host 
      cells. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential enzyme in RNA viruses, 
      which is involved in RNA synthesis through the formation of phosphodiester bonds. 
      Therefore, in RNA viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, RdRp could be a crucial 
      therapeutic target. The present review discusses the promising application of RdRp 
      inhibitors, previously approved or currently being tested in human clinical trials, 
      in the treatment of RNA virus infections. Nucleoside inhibitors (NIs) bind to the 
      active site of RdRp, while nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) bind to allosteric sites. 
      Given the absence of highly effective drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, the 
      discovery of an efficient treatment for this pandemic is an urgent concern for 
      researchers around the world. We review the evidence for molnupiravir (MK-4482, 
      EIDD-2801), an antiviral drug originally designed for Alphavirus infections, as a 
      potential preventive and therapeutic agent for the management of COVID-19. At the 
      beginning of this pandemic, molnupiravir was in preclinical development for seasonal 
      influenza. When COVID-19 spread dramatically, the timeline for development was 
      accelerated to focus on the treatment of this pandemic. Real time consultation with 
      regulators took place to expedite this program. We summarize the therapeutic 
      potential of RdRp inhibitors, and highlight molnupiravir as a new small molecule 
      drug for COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Rethinking Remdesivir: Synthesis, Antiviral Activity and Pharmacokinetics of Oral 
      Lipid Prodrugs.
LID - 2020.08.26.269159 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2020.08.26.269159 [doi]
AB  - Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is currently the only FDA-approved antiviral drug for the 
      treatment of SARS CoV-2 infection. The drug is approved for use in adults or 
      children 12-years or older who are hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19 on the 
      basis of an acceleration of clinical recovery for inpatients with this disease. 
      Unfortunately, the drug must be administered intravenously, restricting its use to 
      those requiring hospitalization for relatively advanced disease. RDV is also 
      unstable in plasma and has a complex activation pathway which may contribute to its 
      highly variable antiviral efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Potent orally 
      bioavailable antiviral drugs for early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection are 
      urgently needed and several including molnupiravir and PF-07321332 are currently in 
      clinical development. We focused on making simple, orally bioavailable lipid analogs 
      of Remdesivir nucleoside (RVn, GS-441524) that are processed to RVn-monophosphate, 
      the precursor of the active RVn-triphosphate, by a single-step intracellular 
      cleavage. In addition to high oral bioavailability, stability in plasma and simpler 
      metabolic activation, new oral lipid prodrugs of RVn had submicromolar 
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a variety of cell types including Vero E6, Calu-3, 
      Caco-2, human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived lung cells and Huh7.5 cells. In 
      Syrian hamsters oral treatment with ODBG-P-RVn was well tolerated and achieved 
      therapeutic levels in plasma above the EC(90) for SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest 
      further evaluation as an early oral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection to minimize 
      severe disease and reduce hospitalizations.

LID - 10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00219 [doi]
AB  - A scalable four-step synthesis of molnupiravir from cytidine is described herein. 
      The attractiveness of this approach is its fully chemical nature involving 
      inexpensive reagents and more environmentally friendly solvents such as water, 
      isopropanol, acetonitrile, and acetone. Isolation and purification procedures are 
      improved in comparison to our earlier study as all intermediates can be isolated via 
      recrystallization. The key steps in the synthesis, namely, ester formation, 
      hydroxyamination, and deprotection were carried out on a multigram scale to afford 
      molnupiravir in 36-41% yield with an average purity of 98 wt % by qNMR and 99 area% 
      by HPLC.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic progresses unabated in many regions of the world. An effective 
      antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that could be administered orally for use following 
      high-risk exposure would be of substantial benefit in controlling the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Herein, we show that MK-4482, an orally administered nucleoside analog, 
      inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in the Syrian hamster model. The inhibitory effect 
      of MK-4482 on SARS-CoV-2 replication is observed in animals when the drug is 
      administered either beginning 12 h before or 12 h following infection in a high-risk 
      exposure model. These data support the potential utility of MK-4482 to control 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans following high-risk exposure as well as for treatment 
      of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Human genetic risk of treatment with antiviral nucleoside analog drugs that induce 
      lethal mutagenesis: The special case of molnupiravir.
PG  - 37-63
LID - 10.1002/em.22471 [doi]
AB  - This review considers antiviral nucleoside analog drugs, including ribavirin, 
      favipiravir, and molnupiravir, which induce genome error catastrophe in SARS-CoV or 
      SARS-CoV-2 via lethal mutagenesis as a mode of action. In vitro data indicate that 
      molnupiravir may be 100 times more potent as an antiviral agent than ribavirin or 
      favipiravir. Molnupiravir has recently demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 clinical 
      trial. Because of its anticipated global use, its relative potency, and the reported 
      in vitro "host" cell mutagenicity of its active principle, β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, 
      we have reviewed the development of molnupiravir and its genotoxicity safety 
      evaluation, as well as the genotoxicity profiles of three congeners, that is, 
      ribavirin, favipiravir, and 5-(2-chloroethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine. We consider the 
      potential genetic risks of molnupiravir on the basis of all available information 
      and focus on the need for additional human genotoxicity data and follow-up in 
      patients treated with molnupiravir and similar drugs. Such human data are especially 
      relevant for antiviral NAs that have the potential of permanently modifying the 
      genomes of treated patients and/or causing human teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. 
      We conclude that the results of preclinical genotoxicity studies and phase 1 human 
      clinical safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics are critical components of drug 
      safety assessments and sentinels of unanticipated adverse health effects. We provide 
      our rationale for performing more thorough genotoxicity testing prior to and within 
      phase 1 clinical trials, including human PIG-A and error corrected next generation 
      sequencing (duplex sequencing) studies in DNA and mitochondrial DNA of patients 
      treated with antiviral NAs that induce genome error catastrophe via lethal 
      mutagenesis.

TI  - [Plitidepsin, an inhibitor of the cell elongation factor eEF1a, and molnupiravir an 
      analogue of the ribonucleoside cytidine, two new chemical compounds with intense 
      activity against SARS-CoV-2].

AB  - The knowledge of the replicative cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with 
      cellular proteins has opened a new therapeutic possibility based on blocking those 
      essential for the virus. The cellular protein elongation factor eEF1A could be a 
      good target. Among its natural inhibitors are didemnins and their related chemical 
      compounds such as plitidepsin. In human cell culture, this compound is capable of 
      inhibiting the virus with a potency 27,5 times that of remdesivir. It must be 
      administered intravenously. Of the ribonucleoside analogues, molnupiravir 
      (MK-4483/EIDD-2801) (hydroxy-cytidine) determines a lethal mutagenesis on 
      SARS-CoV-2. In animals, after oral administration, the pulmonary viral load 
      decreases 25,000 times and when administered as prophylaxis, approximately 100,000 
      times. It prevents the transmission of the virus and eliminates its presence in the 
      oropharynx. Both chemicals have started Phase I / II human clinical trials.

AB  - Thousands of drugs, nutraceuticals and their combinations can be used to select 
      candidate therapeutics for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its symptoms in order to curb 
      COVID-19. A comprehensive, multi-level strategy against COVID-19 should include drug 
      targeting of biomolecules and biochemical pathways involved in the prevention and 
      proliferation of the infection, and the fatal or serious symptoms following 
      infection. Several drugs are routinely used in the treatment of different categories 
      of seriously ill COVID-19 patients including tocilizumab, remdesivir and 
      dexamethasone. The current risk/benefit assessment supports the emergency testing 
      and approval of more drugs. The process for new drug selection could be based on the 
      identification of one drug for one target, or of a multi-potent drug for many 
      targets and drug combinations for one or more targets, that can cause a substantial 
      reduction in the high mortality rate of COVID-19. Several drugs have been identified 
      that can fit this potential role by targeting different stages of COVID-19 including 
      baricitinib, molnupiravir and PF-07321332/ritonavir and also the combination of 
      deferiprone with N-acetylcysteine for inhibiting the vicious circle of oxidative 
      stress toxicity and endothelial cell damage. Most of these drugs are expected to be 
      effective against all the SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron (B.1.1.529) and also 
      the associated COVID-19 complications.

TI  - Engineered Ribosyl-1-Kinase Enables Concise Synthesis of Molnupiravir, an Antiviral 
      for COVID-19.
PG  - 1980-1985
LID - 10.1021/acscentsci.1c00608 [doi]
AB  - Molnupiravir (MK-4482) is an investigational antiviral agent that is under 
      development for the treatment of COVID-19. Given the potential high demand and 
      urgency for this compound, it was critical to develop a short and sustainable 
      synthesis from simple raw materials that would minimize the time needed to 
      manufacture and supply molnupiravir. The route reported here is enabled through the 
      invention of a novel biocatalytic cascade featuring an engineered ribosyl-1-kinase 
      and uridine phosphorylase. These engineered enzymes were deployed with a 
      pyruvate-oxidase-enabled phosphate recycling strategy. Compared to the initial 
      route, this synthesis of molnupiravir is 70% shorter and approximately 7-fold higher 
      yielding. Looking forward, the biocatalytic approach to molnupiravir outlined here 
      is anticipated to have broad applications for streamlining the synthesis of 
      nucleosides in general.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) continues to challenge the limits of 
      our knowledge and our healthcare system. Here we sought to define the host immune 
      response, a.k.a, the "cytokine storm" that has been implicated in fatal COVID-19 
      using an AI-based approach. METHOD: Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral 
      pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a 'seed' gene; 
      ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of 
      SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells. An AI-based approach 
      was used to explore the utility of the signature in navigating the uncharted 
      territory of Covid-19, setting therapeutic goals, and finding therapeutic solutions. 
      FINDINGS: The 166-gene signature was surprisingly conserved across all viral 
      pandemics, including COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes classified disease severity, 
      inspiring the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP signatures, respectively. The ViP 
      signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid 
      cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and 
      apoptosis determine severity/fatality. Precise therapeutic goals could be 
      formulated; these goals were met in high-dose SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters using 
      either neutralizing antibodies that abrogate SARS-CoV-2•ACE2 engagement or a 
      directly acting antiviral agent, EIDD-2801. IL15/IL15RA were elevated in the lungs 
      of patients with fatal disease, and plasma levels of the cytokine prognosticated 
      disease severity. INTERPRETATION: The ViP signatures provide a quantitative and 
      qualitative framework for titrating the immune response in viral pandemics and may 
      serve as a powerful unbiased tool to rapidly assess disease severity and vet 
      candidate drugs. FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Institutes for 
      Health (NIH) [grants CA151673 and GM138385 (to DS) and AI141630 (to P.G),

AB  - In light of the recent global pandemic, Molnupiravir (MPV) or EIDD-2801, developed 
      for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated influenza, is now being trialled 
      for the treatment of infections caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including 
      COVID-19. A sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the 
      simultaneous quantification of MPV and its metabolite ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) 
      in human plasma and saliva. The analytes were extracted from the matrices by protein 
      precipitation using acetonitrile. This was followed by drying and subsequently 
      injecting the reconstituted solutions onto the column. Chromatographic separation 
      was achieved using a polar Atlantis C(18) column with gradient elution of 1 mM 
      Ammonium acetate in water (pH4.3) and 1 mM Ammonium acetate in acetonitrile. Analyte 
      detection was conducted in negative ionisation mode using SRM. Analysis was 
      performed using stable isotopically labelled (SIL) internal standards (IS). The m/z 
      transitions were: MPV (328.1→126.0), NHC (258.0→125.9) and MPV-SIL (331.0→129.0), 
      NHC-SIL (260.9→128.9). Validation was over a linear range of 2.5-5000 ng/ml for both 
      plasma and saliva. Across four different concentrations, precision and accuracy 
      (intra- and inter-day) were 15%; and recovery of both analytes from plasma and 
      saliva was between 95% and 100% and 65-86% respectively. Clinical pharmacokinetic 
      studies are underway utilising this method for determination of MPV and its 
      metabolite in patients with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801) is a promising orally bioavailable drug candidate 
      for the treatment of COVID-19. Herein, we describe a supply-centered and 
      chromatography-free synthesis of molnupiravir from cytidine, consisting of two 
      steps: a selective enzymatic acylation followed by transamination to yield the final 
      drug product. Both steps have been successfully performed on a decagram scale: the 
      first step at 200 g and the second step at 80 g. Overall, molnupiravir has been 
      obtained in a 41% overall isolated yield compared to a maximum 17% isolated yield in 
      the patented route. This route provides many advantages to the initial route 
      described in the patent literature and would decrease the cost of this 
      pharmaceutical should it prove safe and efficacious in ongoing clinical trials.

TI  - Remdesivir and EIDD-1931 Interact with Human Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporters 1 
      and 2: Implications for Reaching SARS-CoV-2 Viral Sanctuary Sites.
PG  - 548-557
LID - 10.1124/molpharm.121.000333 [doi]
AB  - Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) are present at the blood-testis barrier 
      (BTB), where they can facilitate antiviral drug disposition to eliminate a sanctuary 
      site for viruses detectable in semen. The purpose of this study was to investigate 
      ENT-drug interactions with three nucleoside analogs, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and 
      molnupiravir's active metabolite, β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), and four 
      non-nucleoside molecules repurposed as antivirals for coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). The study used three-dimensional pharmacophores for ENT1 and ENT2 
      substrates and inhibitors and Bayesian machine learning models to identify potential 
      interactions with these transporters. In vitro transport experiments demonstrated 
      that remdesivir was the most potent inhibitor of ENT-mediated [(3)H]uridine uptake 
      (ENT1 IC(50): 39 μM; ENT2 IC(50): 77 μM), followed by EIDD-1931 (ENT1 IC(50): 259 
      μM; ENT2 IC(50): 467 μM), whereas molnupiravir was a modest inhibitor (ENT1 IC(50): 
      701 μM; ENT2 IC(50): 851 μM). Other proposed antivirals failed to inhibit 
      ENT-mediated [(3)H]uridine uptake below 1 mM. Remdesivir accumulation decreased in 
      the presence of 6-S-[(4-nitrophenyl)methyl]-6-thioinosine (NBMPR) by 30% in ENT1 
      cells (P = 0.0248) and 27% in ENT2 cells (P = 0.0054). EIDD-1931 accumulation 
      decreased in the presence of NBMPR by 77% in ENT1 cells (P = 0.0463) and by 64% in 
      ENT2 cells (P = 0.0132), which supported computational predictions that both are ENT 
      substrates that may be important for efficacy against COVID-19. NBMPR failed to 
      decrease molnupiravir uptake, suggesting that ENT interaction is likely inhibitory. 
      Our combined computational and in vitro data can be used to identify additional 
      ENT-drug interactions to improve our understanding of drugs that can circumvent the 
      BTB. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study identified remdesivir and EIDD-1931 as 
      substrates of equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2. This provides a 
      potential mechanism for uptake of these drugs into cells and may be important for 
      antiviral potential in the testes and other tissues expressing these transporters.

AB  - There is an urgent need for an effective, oral, direct-acting therapeutic to block 
      transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 
      prevent progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a phase 2a 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, we 
      evaluated the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of the nucleoside analog 
      molnupiravir in 202 unvaccinated participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      and symptom duration <7 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 
      molnupiravir (200 mg) or placebo and then 3:1 to receive molnupiravir (400 or 800 
      mg) or placebo, orally twice daily for 5 days. Antiviral activity was assessed by 
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 
      nasopharyngeal swabs. Infectious virus was assessed by inoculation of cultured Vero 
      cells with samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and was detected by RT-PCR. Time to 
      viral RNA clearance (primary endpoint) was decreased in the 800-mg molnupiravir 
      group (median 14 days) compared to the placebo group (median 15 days) (log rank P 
      value = 0.013). Of participants receiving 800 mg of molnupiravir, 92.5% achieved 
      viral RNA clearance compared with 80.3% of placebo recipients by study end (4 
      weeks). Infectious virus (secondary endpoint) was detected in swabs from 1.9% of the 
      800-mg molnupiravir group compared with 16.7% of the placebo group at day 3 of 
      treatment (P = 0.016). At day 5 of treatment, infectious virus was not isolated from 
      any participants receiving 400 or 800 mg of molnupiravir compared with 11.1% of 
      placebo recipients (P = 0.034 and 0.027, respectively). Molnupiravir was well 
      tolerated across all doses.

TI  - Fair Allocation of Scarce Therapies for COVID-19.
LID - ciab1039 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciab1039 [doi]
AB  - The U.S. FDA has issued emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for monoclonal 
      antibodies (mAbs) for non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 
      disease and for individuals exposed to COVID-19 as post-exposure prophylaxis. One 
      EUA for an oral antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has also been recommended by FDA's 
      Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee, and others appear likely in the near future. 
      Due to increased demand because of the Delta variant, the federal government resumed 
      control over the supply and asked states to ration doses. As future variants with 
      increased infectivity and/or severity (e.g., potentially the Omicron variant) 
      emerge, further rationing may be required. We identify relevant ethical principles 
      (i.e., benefiting people and preventing harm, equal concern, and mitigating health 
      inequities) and priority groups for access to therapies based on an integrated 
      approach to population health and medical factors (e.g. urgently scarce healthcare 
      workers, persons in disadvantaged communities hard hit by COVID-19). Using priority 
      categories to allocate scarce therapies effectively operationalizes important 
      ethical values. This strategy is preferable to the current approach of categorical 
      rules based on vaccination, immunocompromise status, or older age, or the ad hoc 
      consideration of clinical risk factors.

AB  - More than a year ago, the first case of infection by a new coronavirus was 
      identified, which subsequently produced a pandemic causing human deaths throughout 
      the world. Much research has been published on this virus, and discoveries indicate 
      that oxidative stress contributes to the possibility of getting sick from the new 
      SARS-CoV-2. It follows that free radical scavengers may be useful for the treatment 
      of coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19). This report investigates the antioxidant 
      properties of nine antivirals, two anticancer molecules, one antibiotic, one 
      antioxidant found in orange juice (Hesperidin), one anthelmintic and one 
      antiparasitic (Ivermectin). A molecule that is apt for scavenging free radicals can 
      be either an electron donor or electron acceptor. The results I present here show 
      Valrubicin as the best electron acceptor (an anticancer drug with three F atoms in 
      its structure) and elbasvir as the best electron donor (antiviral for chronic 
      hepatitis C). Most antiviral drugs are good electron donors, meaning that they are 
      molecules capable of reduzing other molecules. Ivermectin and Molnupiravir are two 
      powerful COVID-19 drugs that are not good electron acceptors, and the fact that they 
      are not as effective oxidants as other molecules may be an advantage. Electron 
      acceptor molecules oxidize other molecules and affect the conditions necessary for 
      viral infection, such as the replication and spread of the virus, but they may also 
      oxidize molecules that are essential for life. This means that the weapons used to 
      defend us from COVID-19 may also harm us. This study posits the idea that oxide 
      reduction balance may help explain the toxicity or efficacy of these drugs. These 
      results represent a further advance on the road towards understanding the action 
      mechanisms of drugs used as possible treatments for COVID-19. Looking ahead, 
      clinical studies are needed to define the importance of antioxidants in treating 
      COVID-19.

TI  - Potential COVID-19 Drug Candidates Based on Diazinyl-Thiazol-Imine Moieties: 
      Synthesis and Greener Pastures Biological Study.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020488 [doi]
LID - 488
AB  - A novel series of 1-aryl-N-[4-phenyl-5-(arylazo)thiazol-2-yl)methanimines has been 
      synthesized via the condensation of 2-amino-4-phenyl-5-arylazothiazole with various 
      aromatic aldehydes. The synthesized imines were characterized by spectroscopic 
      techniques, namely (1)H and (13)C-NMR, FTIR, MS, and Elemental Analysis. A molecular 
      comparative docking study for 3a-f was calculated, with reference to two approved 
      drugs, Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, using 7BQY (M(pro); PDB code 7BQY; resolution: 
      1.7 A°) under identical conditions. The binding scores against 7BQY were in the 
      range of -7.7 to -8.7 kcal/mol for 3a-f. The high scores of the compounds indicated 
      an enhanced binding affinity of the molecules to the receptor. This is due to the 
      hydrophobic interactions and multi-hydrogen bonds between 3a-f ligands and the 
      receptor's active amino acid residues. The main aim of using in silco molecular 
      docking was to rank 3a-f with respect to the approved drugs, Molnupiravir and 
      Remdesivir, using free energy methods as greener pastures. A further interesting 
      comparison presented the laydown of the ligands before and after molecular docking. 
      These results and other supporting statistical analyses suggested that ligands 3a-f 
      deserve further investigation in the context of potential therapeutic agents for 
      COVID-19. Free-cost, PASS, SwissADME, and Way2drug were used in this research paper 
      to determine the possible biological activities and cytotoxicity of 3a-f.

PG  - e0009721

AB  - Efforts to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic include the 
      screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be repurposed to treat severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Although 
      SARS-CoV-2 replicates and propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney 
      (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) often show decreased 
      activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits low 
      viability in human cells in culture. Here, serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate 
      (original-SARS2) in the human hepatoma cell clone Huh7.5 led to the selection of a 
      variant (adapted-SARS2) with significantly improved infectivity in human liver (Huh7 
      and Huh7.5) and lung cancer (unmodified Calu-1 and A549) cells. The adapted virus 
      exhibited mutations in the spike protein, including a 9-amino-acid deletion and 3 
      amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). E484D also emerged in Vero E6-cultured 
      viruses that became viable in A549 cells. Original and adapted viruses were 
      susceptible to scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) receptor blocking, and 
      adapted-SARS2 exhibited significantly less dependence on ACE2. Both variants were 
      similarly neutralized by COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma, but adapted-SARS2 
      exhibited increased susceptibility to exogenous type I interferon. Remdesivir 
      inhibited original- and adapted-SARS2 similarly, demonstrating the utility of the 
      system for the screening of NUCs. Among the tested NUCs, only remdesivir, 
      molnupiravir, and, to a limited extent, galidesivir showed antiviral effects across 
      human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent 
      activity. Analogously to the emergence of spike mutations in vivo, the spike protein 
      is under intense adaptive selection pressure in cell culture. Our results indicate 
      that the emergence of spike mutations will most likely not affect the activity of 
      remdesivir.

AB  - We assessed the in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir and its parent nucleoside 
      GS-441524, molnupiravir and its parent nucleoside EIDD-1931 and the viral protease 
      inhibitor nirmatrelvir against the ancestral SARS-CoV2 strain and the five variants 
      of concern including Omicron. VeroE6-GFP cells were pre-treated overnight with 
      serial dilutions of the compounds before infection. The GFP signal was determined by 
      high-content imaging on day 4 post-infection. All molecules have equipotent 
      antiviral activity against the ancestral virus and the VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma, 
      Delta and Omicron. These findings are in line with the observation that the target 
      proteins of these antivirals (respectively the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase 
      and the viral main protease Mpro) are highly conserved.

AB  - Molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801) is an experimental drug that has been demonstrated 
      to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in human clinical trials. Herein, we 
      report a concise synthesis of the drug via a novel thionated derivative that relies 
      on one-pot methodologies, thus decreasing the number of purification steps required. 
      This route provides the drug in an overall 62% yield and >99% purity and uses cheap 
      and readily available bulk chemicals, thereby providing an affordable synthesis of 
      the drug for cheaper and wider global accessibility.

AB  - The novel antiviral prodrug molnupiravir is under evaluation for the treatment of 
      SARS-CoV-2. Molnupiravir is converted to β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), which is 
      the primary form found in systemic circulation. 
      β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine-triphosphate (NHCtp) is the bioactive anabolite produced 
      intracellularly. Sensitive and accurate bioanalytical methods are required to 
      characterize NHC and NHCtp pharmacokinetics in clinical trials. Human K(2)EDTA 
      plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysates were spiked with NHC 
      (plasma) or NHCtp (PBMC), respectively. Following the addition of 
      isotopically-labeled internal standards and sample extraction via protein 
      precipitation or lysate dilution, respectively, samples were subjected to liquid 
      chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Methods were 
      validated in accordance with FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation recommendations. 
      NHC can be quantified in plasma with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 
      1 ng/mL; the primary linearity of the assay is 1-5000 ng/mL. Assay precision and 
      accuracy were ≤ 6.40% and ≤ ± 6.37%, respectively. NHC is unstable in whole blood 
      and has limited stability in plasma at room temperature. The calibration range for 
      NHCtp in PBMC lysates is 1-1500 pmol/sample, and the assay has an LLOQ of 
      1 pmol/sample. Assay precision and accuracy were ≤ 11.8% and ≤± 11.2%. Ion 
      suppression was observed for both analytes; isotopically-labeled internal standards 
      showed comparable ion suppression, resulting in negligible (<5%) relative matrix 
      effects. Sensitive, specific, and dynamic LC-MS/MS assays have been developed and 
      validated for the quantification of NHC in plasma and NHCtp in PBMC lysates. The 
      described methods are appropriate for use in clinical trials.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought an unprecedented public health crisis and 
      persistently threatens to humanity. With tireless efforts from scientists around the 
      world, understanding of the biology of coronavirus has been greatly enhanced over 
      the past 2 years. Structural biology has demonstrated its powerful impact on 
      uncovering structures and functions for the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 
      guided the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19. In this review, we 
      summarize current progress in the structural biology of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss 
      important biological issues that remain to be addressed. We present the examples of 
      structure-based design of Pfizer's novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug PF-07321332 
      (Paxlovid), Merck's nucleotide inhibitor molnupiravir (Lagevrio), and VV116, an oral 
      drug candidate for COVID-19. These examples highlight the importance of structure in 
      drug discovery to combat COVID-19. We also discussed the recent variants of Omicron 
      and its implication in immunity escape from existing vaccines and antibody 
      therapies.

AB  - The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 created by its severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, known for producing a very 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome, has created an unprecedented situation by its 
      continual assault around the world. The crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant has 
      been a global challenge, calling to mitigate this unprecedented pandemic that has 
      engulfed the whole world. Since the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, many 
      researchers globally have been grappling to find new clinically trialed active drugs 
      with anti-COVID-19 activity, from antimalarial drugs to JAK inhibitors, antiviral 
      drugs, immune suppressants, and so forth. This article presents a brief discussion 
      on the activity and synthesis of some active molecules such as favipiravir, 
      hydroxychloroquine, pirfenidone, remdesivir, lopinavir, camostat, chloroquine, 
      baricitinib, molnupiravir, and so forth, which are under trial.

TI  - Oral antivirals for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
LID - 10.24875/AIDSRev.22000001 [doi]
AB  - Vaccines and antivirals are the classical weapons deployed to contain, prevent, and 
      treat life-threatening viral illnesses. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      vaccines protect against severe COVID-19 disease manifestations and complications. 
      However, waning immunity and emergence of vaccine escape mutants remains a growing 
      threat. This is highlighted by the current surge of the omicron COVID-19 variant. 
      Thus, there is a race to find treatment alternatives. We contend that oral small 
      molecule antivirals that halt SARSCoV- 2 infection are essential. Compared to 
      currently available monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir, where parenteral 
      administration is required, oral antivirals offer treatments in an outpatient 
      setting with dissemination available on a larger scale. In response to this need at 
      2021's end, regulatory agencies provided emergency use authorization for both 
      molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir. These medicines act on the viral polymerase and 
      protease, respectively. Each is given for 5 days and can reduce disease progression 
      by 30% and 89%, respectively. The advent of additional oral antivirals, the 
      assessment of combination therapies, the formulation of extended-release 
      medications, and their benefit for both early treatment and prophylaxis will likely 
      transform the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Many 
      clinical trials have been performed to investigate potential treatments or vaccines 
      for this disease to reduce the high morbidity and mortality. The drugs of higher 
      interest include umifenovir, bromhexine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, steroid, 
      tocilizumab, interferon alpha or beta, ribavirin, fivapiravir, nitazoxanide, 
      ivermectin, molnupiravir, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone or in combination 
      with azithromycin, and baricitinib. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and liver 
      dysfunction are frequently seen in patients with COVID-19, which can make it 
      difficult to differentiate disease manifestations from treatment adverse effects. GI 
      symptoms of COVID-19 include anorexia, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
      abdominal pain. Liver injury can be a result of systemic inflammation or cytokine 
      storm, or due to the adverse drug effects in patients who have been receiving 
      different treatments. Regular monitoring of liver function should be performed. 
      COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly developed with different technologies including 
      mRNA, viral vectors, inactivated viruses, recombinant DNA, protein subunits and live 
      attenuated viruses. Patients with chronic liver disease or inflammatory bowel 
      disease and liver transplant recipients are encouraged to receive vaccination as the 
      benefits outweigh the risks. Vaccination against COVID-19 is also recommended to 
      family members and healthcare professionals caring for these patients to reduce 
      exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus.

AB  - Safe and effective oral formulation of a drug, that is easy to store, transport, and 
      administer, is imperative to reach the masses including those without adequate 
      facilities and resources, in order to combat globally transmitted coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this decision analytic modeling study, the safety of 
      investigational COVID-19 drugs in clinical trials was assessed using the Abbreviated 
      Profile of Drugs (APOD) methodology. The method was extensively tested for various 
      unbiased datasets based on different criteria such as drugs recalled worldwide for 
      failing to meet safety standards, organ-specific toxicities, cytochrome P450 
      inhibitors, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs with remarkable 
      successes. Experimental validation of the predictions made by APOD were demonstrated 
      by comparison with a progression of multiparametric optimization of a series of 
      cancer drugs that led to a potent drug (GDC-0941) which went into the clinical 
      development. The drugs were classified into three categories of safety profiles: 
      strong, moderate and weak. A total of 3556 drugs available in public databases were 
      examined. According to the results, drugs with strong safety profiles included 
      molnupiravir (EIDD-2801), moderate safety profiles included dexamethasone, and weak 
      safety profiles included lopinavir. In this analysis, the 
      physicochemical-pharmacokinetic APOD fingerprint was associated with the drug safety 
      profile of withdrawn, approved, as well as drugs in clinical trials and the APOD 
      method facilitated decision-making and prioritization of the investigational 
      treatments.

      pathogenesis in mice.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic remains uncontrolled despite the rapid rollout of safe and 
      effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, underscoring the need to develop highly effective 
      antivirals. In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, 
      breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options 
      remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with 
      their potential to escape therapeutic monoclonal antibodies emphasizes the need to 
      develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins 
      that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro 
      antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally 
      bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parental nucleoside of remdesivir, which 
      targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited 
      significant antiviral activity in lung cell lines and two different human primary 
      lung cell culture systems. The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed 
      after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral 
      activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 significantly 
      reduced viral load, lung pathology, and improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 
      mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside 
      analog antiviral currently in human clinical trial, proved both drugs to be 
      similarly efficacious. These data demonstrate that therapy with oral prodrugs of 
      remdesivir can significantly improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. Thus, 
      GS-621763 supports the exploration of GS-441524 oral prodrugs for the treatment of 
      COVID-19 in humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently 
      received emergency use authorization (EUA) in USA, UK and India. We aim to conduct 
      an update on our previous systematic review to provide practical clinical guideline 
      for using molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically 
      searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar until January 
      5, 2022, using key MeSH keywords. RESULTS: Final result of phase 3 study in 1433 
      non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed a significant reduction in composite risk 
      of hospital admission or death (absolute risk difference, -3.0% [95% confidence 
      interval {CI}, -5.9 to -0.1%]; 1-sided P = 0.02) although with a non-significant 31% 
      relative risk reduction (RRR). RRR for death alone was 89% (95% CI, 14 to 99; 
      P-value not reported). Number needed to treat to prevent 1 death or 1 
      hospitalization or death composite appears to be closely competitive to other agents 
      having EUA in people with COVID-19. However, cost-wise molnupiravir is comparatively 
      cheaper compared to all other agents. CONCLUSION: Molnupiravir could be a useful 
      agent in non-pregnant unvaccinated adults with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of 
      severity including hospitalization. However, it is effective only when used within 
      5-days of onset of symptoms. A 5-days course seems to be safe without any obvious 
      short-term side effects.

AB  - There are, besides remdesivir, no approved antivirals for the treatment of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections. To aid in the search for antivirals against this virus, we 
      explored the use of human tracheal airway epithelial cells (HtAEC) and human small 
      airway epithelial cells (HsAEC) grown at the air-liquid interface (ALI). These 
      cultures were infected at the apical side with one of two different SARS-CoV-2 
      isolates. Each virus was shown to replicate to high titers for extended periods of 
      time (at least 8 days) and, in particular an isolate with the D614G in the spike (S) 
      protein did so more efficiently at 35 °C than 37 °C. The effect of a selected panel 
      of reference drugs that were added to the culture medium at the basolateral side of 
      the system was explored. Remdesivir, GS-441524 (the parent nucleoside of 
      remdesivir), EIDD-1931 (the parent nucleoside of molnupiravir) and IFN (β1 and λ1) 
      all resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of viral RNA and infectious virus titers 
      collected at the apical side. However, AT-511 (the free base form of AT-527 
      currently in clinical testing) failed to inhibit viral replication in these in vitro 
      primary cell models. Together, these results provide a reference for further studies 
      aimed at selecting SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors for further preclinical and clinical 
      development.

AB  - Recently, Remdesivir and Molnupiravir were approved for treating COVID-19 caused by 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little is known about the impact of these drugs on 
      other viruses pre-existed in COVID-19 patients. Here we report that Remdesivir but 
      not Molnupiravir induced lytic reactivation of KSHV and EBV, two major oncogenic 
      herpesviruses. Remdesivir induced mature virion production from latently infected 
      cells. Mechanistic studies showed that Remdesivir induced KSHV and EBV reactivation 
      by regulating several intracellular signaling pathways.

TI  - Combination of Antiviral Drugs to Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase and Exonuclease as 
      Potential COVID-19 Therapeutics.
LID - 2021.07.21.453274 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2021.07.21.453274 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader, which removes nucleotide inhibitors 
      such as Remdesivir that are incorporated into the viral RNA during replication, 
      reducing the efficacy of these drugs for treating COVID-19. Combinations of 
      inhibitors of both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the exonuclease could 
      overcome this deficiency. Here we report the identification of hepatitis C virus 
      NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease inhibitors. In 
      the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the active forms of the prodrugs 
      Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir and AT-527 were largely protected 
      from excision by the exonuclease, while in the absence of Pibrentasvir, there was 
      rapid excision. Due to its unique structure, Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly 
      resistant to exonuclease excision even in the absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell 
      culture studies also demonstrate significant synergy using this combination 
      strategy. This study supports the use of combination drugs that inhibit both the 
      SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for effective COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike mediated immune escape and tropism shift.
LID - rs.3.rs-1191837 [pii]
LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-1191837/v1 [doi]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in late 2021 and is characterised by 
      multiple spike mutations across all spike domains. Here we show that Omicron BA.1 
      has higher affinity for ACE2 compared to Delta, and confers very significant evasion 
      of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising antibodies 
      after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens 
      neutralisation. Importantly, antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir retain 
      efficacy against Omicron BA.1. We found that in human nasal epithelial 3D cultures 
      replication was similar for both Omicron and Delta. However, in lower airway 
      organoids, Calu-3 lung cells and gut adenocarcinoma cell lines live Omicron virus 
      demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to Delta. We noted that 
      despite presence of mutations predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, the spike 
      protein is less efficiently cleaved in live Omicron virions compared to Delta 
      virions. We mapped the replication differences between the variants to entry 
      efficiency using spike pseudotyped virus (PV) entry assays. The defect for Omicron 
      PV in specific cell types correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, 
      and accordingly knock down of TMPRSS2 impacted Delta entry to a greater extent as 
      compared to Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways 
      demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently utilises the cellular protease 
      TMPRSS2 that mediates cell entry via plasma membrane fusion. Instead, we demonstrate 
      that Omicron spike has greater dependency on cell entry via the endocytic pathway 
      requiring the activity of endosomal cathepsins to cleave spike. Consistent with 
      suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to utilise TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by 
      the Omicron spike was dramatically impaired compared to the Delta spike. Overall, 
      Omicron appears to have gained significant evasion from neutralising antibodies 
      whilst maintaining sensitivity to antiviral drugs targeting the polymerase. Omicron 
      has shifted cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2 expressing cells that are enriched in 
      cells found in the lower respiratory and GI tracts, with implications for altered 
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Efficacy of the use of mefenamic acid combined with standard medical care vs. 
      standard medical care alone for the treatment of COVID‑19: A randomized double‑blind 
      placebo‑controlled trial.
LID - 29 [pii]
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2022.5084 [doi]
AB  - Mefenamic acid is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug exhibiting a wide range of 
      anti‑inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and probable antiviral activities. The 
      present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with mefenamic acid combined with 
      standard medical care vs. standard medical care plus a placebo in ambulatory 
      patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19; nasal/oropharyngeal swabs reverse 
      transcription‑PCR test results positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2). The present study is a phase II prospective, two‑arm, 
      parallel‑group, randomized, double‑blind placebo‑controlled clinical trial which 
      analyzed 36 patients. Two aspects were evaluated during the 14‑day follow‑up period: 
      i) The time for reaching a patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), and ii) the last 
      day of each COVID‑19 symptom presentation. Adverse effects were evaluated. The 
      clinical severity for all the patients in the study was mild (88.9%) and moderate 
      (11.1%). The control (placebo) group achieved PASS on day 8.0±1.3, compared with 
      day 4.4±0.8 in the mefenamic acid group (P=0.020, Kaplan‑Meier analyses using 
      log‑rank tests). Patients that received mefenamic acid plus standard medical care 
      had a ~16‑fold higher probability of achieving PASS on day 8 (adjusted RR, 15.57; 
      95% CI, 1.22‑198.71; P=0.035), compared with the placebo plus standard medical care 
      group. All symptoms lasted for fewer days in the mefenamic acid group, compared with 
      the placebo group; however, only the symptoms of headache (P=0.008), retro‑orbital 
      eye pain (P=0.049), and sore throat (P=0.029) exhibited statistically significant 
      differences. The experimental treatment produced no severe adverse effects. On the 
      whole, the present study demonstrates that the administration of mefenamic acid 
      markedly reduced the symptomatology and time to reach PASS in ambulatory patients 
      with COVID‑19. Due to its probable antiviral effects and potent anti‑inflammatory 
      mechanisms, mefenamic acid may prove to be useful in the treatment of COVID‑19, in 
      combination with other drugs, including the new antivirals (remdesivir, 
      molnupiravir, or favipiravir). However, future studies are also required to confirm 
      these findings.

TI  - Repurposing Drugs for Mayaro Virus: Identification of EIDD-1931, Favipiravir and 
      Suramin as Mayaro Virus Inhibitors.

AB  - Despite the emerging threat of the Mayaro virus (MAYV) in Central and South-America, 
      there are no licensed antivirals or vaccines available for this neglected 
      mosquito-borne virus. Here, we optimized a robust antiviral assay based on the 
      inhibition of the cytopathogenic effect that could be used for high-throughput 
      screening to identify MAYV inhibitors. We first evaluated different cell lines and 
      virus inputs to determine the best conditions for a reliable and reproducible 
      antiviral assay. Next, we used this assay to evaluate a panel of antiviral compounds 
      with known activity against other arboviruses. Only three drugs were identified as 
      inhibitors of MAYV: β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), favipiravir and suramin. 
      The in vitro anti-MAYV activity of these antiviral compounds was further confirmed 
      in a virus yield assay. These antivirals can therefore serve as reference compounds 
      for future anti-MAYV compound testing. In addition, it is of interest to further 
      explore the activity of EIDD-1931 and its orally bioavailable pro-drug molnupiravir 
      in animal infection models to determine whether it offers promise for the treatment 
      of MAYV infection.

TI  - Very low levels of remdesivir resistance in SARS-COV-2 genomes after 18 months of 
      massive usage during the COVID19 pandemic: A GISAID exploratory analysis.

AB  - Massive usage of antiviral compounds during a pandemic creates an ideal ground for 
      emergence of resistant strains. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the viral 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), was extensively prescribed under emergency use 
      authorization during the first 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic, before randomized 
      controlled trials showed poor efficacy in hospitalized patients. RdRp mutations 
      conferring resistance to remdesivir are well known from in vitro studies, and the 
      huge SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic represents an 
      unprecedented opportunity to assess emergence and fitness of antiviral resistance in 
      vivo. We mined the GISAID database to extrapolate the frequency of remdesivir escape 
      mutations. Our analysis reveals very low levels of remdesivir resistance worldwide 
      despite massive usage.

AB  - Remdesivir (GS-5734), a drug initially developed to treat hepatitis C and Ebola 
      virus disease, was the first approved treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). However, apart from remdesivir, there is a paucity of other specific 
      anti-viral agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 2017, researchers had documented 
      the anti-coronavirus potential of remdesivir in animal models. At the same time, 
      trials performed during two Ebola outbreaks in Africa showed that the drug was safe. 
      Although vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have emerged at an enormously high 
      speed, equivalent results from efforts towards the development of anti-viral drugs, 
      which could have played a truly life-saving role in the current stage of the 
      pandemic, have been stagnating. In this review, we will focus on the current 
      treatment options for COVID-19 which mainly consist of repurposed agents or 
      treatments conferring passive immunity (convalescent plasma or monoclonal 
      antibodies). Additionally, potential specific anti-viral therapies under development 
      will be reviewed, such as the decoy miniprotein CTC-445.2d, protease inhibitors, 
      mainly against the Main protein Mpro, nucleoside analogs, such as molnupiravir and 
      compounds blocking the replication transcription complex proteins, such as zotatifin 
      and plitidepsin. These anti-viral agents seem to be very promising but still require 
      meticulous clinical trial testing in order to establish their efficacy and safety. 
      The continuous emergence of viral variants may pose a real challenge to the 
      scientific community towards that end. In this context, the advent of nanobodies 
      together with the potential administration of a combination of anti-viral drugs 
      could serve as useful tools in the armamentarium against COVID-19.
